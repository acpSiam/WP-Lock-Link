## 🛠️ How It Works?!

1. Go to **Preview Links** from the WordPress admin menu.
2. You will understand yourself.
3. If you tokenize entire website single pages tokenizing will not work.
4. Even after removing token if a page/the site is not visitable, add a new token and delete it. It will work.

## 🧼 Uninstall Behavior

- All saved preview tokens are **automatically removed** when you delete the plugin.
- Token cookies are invalidated on the next visit.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Prepare or Download the zip from here and upload it from pluggins in your wordpress.
2. I havent yet planned to upload it in plugin store of WP.
